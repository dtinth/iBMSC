µBMSC
=====
µBMSC is a modified version of iBMSC to add features and clean up the iBMSC code, fix bugs and so on.
See README.md.old for previous README file.

This repo contains @dtinth’s fork with these extra features (some of them are merged to µBMSC):

- [Support for bmson-style “continuation notes” based on BMS-on proposal](https://github.com/zardoru/iBMSC/pull/11).

- [Note charting shortcuts](https://github.com/zardoru/iBMSC/pull/12) (merged) with [sounds](https://github.com/zardoru/iBMSC/pull/13).

Please download the source code and build yourself. (It should work with Visual Studio 2017 Community.)
